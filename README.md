### Executive Summary

The "Machine Learning with Python" section of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate covered various Machine Learning topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, and classification. The course provided an overview of different algorithms and techniques, such as K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Regression Trees, and how to apply them to real-world problems. 

#### 01 - Simple-Linear-Regression.ipynb

Implemented simple linear regression using scikit-learn to model and predict fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Evaluated the model's accuracy using MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.

#### 02 - Multiple Linear Regression.ipynb

Implemented multiple linear regression using scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption. Explored different features for improved accuracy.

#### 03 - K-Nearest Neighbours.ipynb

 Demonstrates the use of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification on a customer dataset. The dataset is used to predict customer group membership based on demographic data. The notebook also covers the concept of train-test split for accurate evaluation of the model's performance.

Implemented simple linear regression using scikit-learn to model and predict fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Evaluated the model's accuracy using MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.

#### 04 - Decision Trees.ipynb

Demonstrates the use of Decision Trees for classification in healthcare. The dataset contains patient information and drug response, enabling the development of a model to predict suitable medications for future patients. The notebook covers data pre-processing, decision tree setup, modeling, prediction, evaluation, and visualization.
