You can model the problem as a binary classification problem. A transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).\n","    <br>\n","    <br>You have access to transactions that occured over a certain period of time. The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced.

This case requires special attention when training or when evaluating the quality of a model.
